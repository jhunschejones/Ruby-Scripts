# Ruby Scripts
This repo houses a somewhat eclectic collection of Ruby scripts I've created at different times to help make complex or repetitive tasks easier.

## Contents
* [`categorize`](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Ruby-Scripts/tree/master/categorize): A CSV parsing and formatting script I use for manipulating credit card statements to work with my reporting infrastructure
* [`movie_formatter`](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Ruby-Scripts/tree/master/movie_formatter): A file-organization script I use for managing my personal digital movie collection
* [`episode_namer`](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Ruby-Scripts/tree/master/episode_namer): A file-naming script I use for managing directories of tv episodes
* [`spotify_ruby`](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Ruby-Scripts/tree/master/spotify_ruby): A console app to play with the Spotify API for potential use in a future version of Album Tags.
* [`vlc_dual_audio`](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Ruby-Scripts/tree/master/vlc_dual_audio): A script to wrap the VLC CLI tool and make playing dual audio movies easier.
* [`cost_adder`](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Ruby-Scripts/tree/master/cost_adder): A script that reads dollar values out of a blob of text and sums the total of the amounts.

I initially included my Japanese language learning scripts in this repository as well, but they have since been moved to [Language Learning Tools](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Language-Learning-Tools).
