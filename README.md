# Ruby Scripts
This repo houses a somewhat eclectic collection of Ruby scripts I've created at different times to help make complex or repetitive tasks easier.

## Contents
* [`categorize`](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Ruby-Scripts/tree/master/catagorize): A CSV parsing and formatting script I use for manipulating credit card statements to work with my reporting infrastructure
* [`movie_formatter`](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Ruby-Scripts/tree/master/movie_formatter): A file-organization script I use for managing my personal digital movie collection
