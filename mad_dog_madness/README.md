# Mad Dog Madness

A script that creates randomized TDWP stanzas by using real lines from songs, spliced in with directions from my apartment to Dayton Ohio.

### Using the script:
To generate the next hit TWDP single, simply use `./bin/run`

### Examples:
```
We awake in total fear
The road says it's time to go (Living at a cost)
Turn right at the 1st cross street
We didn't choose violence

Is this the night of our demise
Termination
Take exit 46A to merge onto US-36 E toward Cameron
Still man allots contagion

The exit is infection
No one should want to kill
Use the left 2 lanes to take exit 112A for Interstate 70 E toward Columbus OH
Purpose compromised

Complete retreat since the outbreak
Fighting for every step
Turn left onto W Pioneers Blvd
Seething eyes and punctured flesh

Subject your force (How can we)
Continue onto NE Wheeler Ave
It's that slow traverse
The shadows move from
```
