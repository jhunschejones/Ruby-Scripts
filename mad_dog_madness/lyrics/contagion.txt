How can we keep our heads above?
This slow motion is speeding up

Solidified conclusion
Permanence, no solution

It's been quite some time
Since the infection
Evolving axis of cessation

Still man allots contagion
Diminishing population
Formalize a statement's period
While brighter minds

Subject some force (How can we)
Every breath (Keep our heads above?)
Offer your strength (This slow motion)
Push the pace (Is speeding up)
Against death
Against death

We can't last much longer
We can't last much longer
Depleted legs, a truest factor
We can't last much longer

It's been quite some time
Each day fleeing the hoards
Still man allots contagion
Diminishing population

Upset the sickness
But it seems that it's too late
Upset the sickness
Can we take our lives back?
They scream and grasp
Who knows if this will pass?
Upset the sickness
Can we take our lives back?

How can we keep our heads above?
This slow motion is speeding up

Subject your force (How can we)
Forget the last
Time they hurt you (Keep our heads above?)
Ignore the past
Just come with your might (This slow motion)
Ready to fight
Down to the wire (Is speeding up)
We must upset the sickness
