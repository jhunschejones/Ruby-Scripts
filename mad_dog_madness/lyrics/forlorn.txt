At the time of the onset
Humanity mismanaged
The gravity of the virus

It's hopeless now, this tragedy
Exhausted of necessities
We're forced to flee without escape
Complete retreat since the outbreak

Biblical devastation
Superlative damage

We've lost control
We're in a panic
We've lost control
Like we ever had it

Reduced to nothing
Reduced to sorrow

We've lost control
We're in a panic

It's hopeless now, this tragedy
Exhausted of necessities
We're forced to flee without escape
Complete retreat since the outbreak

It's hopeless now, this tragedy
Exhausted of necessities
We're forced to flee without escape
Complete retreat since the outbreak

We're forlorn and I know that
We've been torn from what we once loved
Selfish, so selfish (Selfish, so selfish)
Forlorn and I know that
We've been torn from what we once loved

It's hopeless now, this tragedy
Exhausted of necessities
We're forced to flee without escape
Complete retreat since the outbreak
