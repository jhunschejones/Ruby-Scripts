Night fall
Night fall
Rise

Creeping up getting closer
All forms of prevention lost
Notify your ensuing ghost
The shadows move from

East to west like clockwork
They're hiding from the light
We sleep in anticipation
We awake in total fear
Every window boarded up
Our fate is drawing near

Night fall
Night fall
We rise at night

The sunrise
Brings an end
But can you make it 'til dawn?
You can't hide
From the dead
But can you make it 'til dawn?

What walks beyond the doorway?
Looming torture jaws baring

Is this the night of our demise
Entwined with hell's faces

Can you make it 'til dawn?
Can you make it 'til dawn?
Can you
Can you make it 'til dawn?

It's that slow traverse
It's that cold flesh
Moving in moving in

Creeping up getting closer
All forms of prevention lost
Notify your ensuing ghost
The shadows move from

East to west like clockwork
They're hiding from the light
We sleep in anticipation
We awake in total fear
Every window boarded up
Our fate is drawing near

They rise at
Night fall
Night fall
They rise at
Night fall
Night fall
They rise at
