Acquiring against will
Shoveled around living bodies
In the sense of projection
An offering for the economy

The transfer begins
Purpose compromised
The transfer begins

We all did our best
We didn't choose violence
The exit is infection
We've met our, we've met our
Termination

I don't mean harm
I'm trying to understand
The state's keeping secrets from me
But actuality is the undead threat

The transfer begins

We all did our best
We didn't choose violence
The exit is infection
We've met our, we've met our
Termination

No one should want to kill
But they were the first to die

All sentiment has been lost
We've met our Termination

Are you living?
Can you hear me?
Are you living?
Can you hear me?

Cause they might be pretending
These weapons are for the dead's ending
