# Unique Cards

Unique Cards is a script that uses text exports of Anki decks to find occurrences of a searched word or phrase. I use this tool as a part of my Japanese language learning workflow to help eliminate duplicate study material or locate previous example sentences that could be re-used in a new card. These issues can be resolved within a single user profile using Anki's built in search, but once a collection spans multiple profiles, a tool like this is required for cross-profile searches.
